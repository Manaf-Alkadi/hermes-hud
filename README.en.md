# Hermes HUD 🛰️

> A local, real-time monitoring command center for Hermes Agent — health overview, token/cost, models, memory, sessions, cron jobs, channels, errors, and machine health at a glance. When something goes wrong, you see it immediately.

**Not [joeynyc/hermes-hud](https://github.com/joeynyc/hermes-hud).** That project is a standalone TUI. This repo is a **user-level plugin** for the official `hermes dashboard` — it does not replace the Dashboard, does not modify the `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` core, survives Hermes upgrades, and uninstalls in one command.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🖥 **One screen, many tabs**: Overview, Live, Token & Cost (Cost Intelligence), Sessions, Timeline, Memory, Skills, Skill Analytics, Cron, Channels, Errors & Incidents, System & Storage, Settings
- ⚡ **2-second realtime**: shared snapshot cache + WebSocket incremental event stream; REST and WS never duplicate collection
- 🔒 **Strict read-only boundary**: Hermes core data is always read-only (`mode=ro`, never locks the Gateway); logs/paths redacted first, fingerprints generated after redaction — raw secrets never leave
- 📊 **Trustworthy cost accounting**: estimated-cost semantics with pricing-provenance coverage (known vs unknown pricing rows) and attribution-aware time windows — never presented as provider invoices
- 🚨 **Proactive alerts**: optional `hud_alert.py` pushes new incidents / upgrades / recoveries to Telegram + Feishu (dedup + confirmed-recovery state machine)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diabloluo/hermes-hud ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-hud
python3 ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-hud/scripts/enable_dashboard_plugin.py enable
hermes dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9119 --no-open
# Open http://127.0.0.1:9119 → "Hermes HUD" in the sidebar
```

> Prebuilt frontend ships in the repo — no web UI rebuild needed.
> Full install/uninstall/troubleshooting: **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** · First-run guide: **[FIRST_5_MINUTES.md](FIRST_5_MINUTES.md)**.

## 🖥 Desktop Alpha for macOS

Native macOS app for Apple Silicon — a desktop window into Hermes:
Agent Timeline, Skill Analytics, Cost Intelligence, health, sessions,
cron jobs, channels, errors and incidents.

- **Local-first · read-only · zero outbound product telemetry**
- Automatically discovers Hermes and connects to an existing Dashboard,
  or safely starts the local Dashboard
- **Developer ID signed + Apple notarized** — accepted by Gatekeeper
  without an "Open Anyway" workaround
- Alpha requirements: **Hermes Agent ≥ 0.19.0 + Hermes HUD plugin ≥ 1.1.1**
  (API schema 1), **Apple Silicon (arm64) only**
- No auto-updater yet
- The Web HUD remains fully supported; Desktop is an additional surface,
  not a replacement

**Bonus**: `scripts/hud_alert.py` — proactive incident push alerts (Telegram + Feishu) on new incidents / severity upgrades / recovery, with deduplication and throttling.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone into your user plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/Diabloluo/hermes-hud ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-hud

# 2. Enable the plugin (read → merge → write back; preserves your other plugins)
python3 ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-hud/scripts/enable_dashboard_plugin.py enable

# 3. Start the Dashboard (backend API routes mount at startup, so restart it)
hermes dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9119 --no-open
# Open http://127.0.0.1:9119 → "Hermes HUD" in the sidebar

# Uninstall (removes only HUD, keeps every other plugin):
python3 ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-hud/scripts/enable_dashboard_plugin.py disable
```

> The repo ships prebuilt frontend assets (`dashboard/dist/`); no need to rebuild the Hermes web UI.
> Only if your Hermes is missing `hermes_cli/web_dist/` (Dashboard shows the boot screen):
> `cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent && npm run install:web && cd web && npm run build`

### Alert helper (optional)

```bash
# .env needs (hud_alert.py loads only these allowlisted variables):
#   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL
#   FEISHU_APP_ID + FEISHU_APP_SECRET + FEISHU_ALLOWED_USERS (open_id)
#   (optional) HUD_TG_PROXY — no proxy by default; set e.g. http://127.0.0.1:7897 where Telegram is blocked
cp scripts/hud_alert.py ~/.hermes/scripts/hud_alert.py
# Test
python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/hud_alert.py --dry-run
# Cron every 5 minutes (inside Hermes):
hermes cron add --script hud_alert.py --schedule '*/5 * * * *' --no-agent
```

## 🏗 Architecture

```
Hermes data sources (read-only)
  ├─ state.db / session_model_usage   ← SQLite read-only connection (mode=ro)
  ├─ cron/jobs.json / executions.db
  ├─ gateway_state.json / process liveness
  ├─ memories/ (MEMORY.md / USER.md)
  ├─ logs/ (agent.log / errors.log)
  └─ ~/.hermes/skills/                ← SKILL.md metadata scan
                 │
                 ▼
       hermes-hud plugin_api.py

        ┌────────┴────────┐
        ▼                 ▼
 snapshot REST       authenticated WebSocket

      ~/.hermes/hud/telemetry.db
   (minute-level metrics / incident fingerprints / short summaries)
```

- Plugin API mounts at `/api/plugins/hermes-hud/`, reusing the Dashboard's standard session-token auth
- WebSocket goes through the Dashboard's standard auth gate (`_ws_auth_ok`); no second token scheme
- telemetry.db is independent of state.db and can be deleted/rebuilt entirely

## 🔒 Security boundary

- Listens on `127.0.0.1` by default; no outbound telemetry
- **Read-only boundary**: Hermes core data is always read-only (state.db opened with `mode=ro` + `query_only` + short timeouts, never locks the Gateway); HUD writes only its own telemetry and alert state under `~/.hermes/hud/`
- **The Dashboard plugin itself never reads `.env` / `auth.json`**; the optional `hud_alert.py` helper loads only the notification credentials it needs (allowlist: TELEGRAM_*/FEISHU_*/HUD_TG_PROXY)
- Logs/conversations/memory are redacted first (key/token/secret/bearer/JWT/long hex/base64); log fingerprints are generated after redaction — raw secrets never enter fingerprints, incidents, APIs or WebSocket
- Conversation and memory bodies never enter the event stream; details load on demand as short previews
- Local paths and command-line summaries are privacy-sanitized (usernames / middle directories hidden)
- telemetry.db stores only aggregates, incident fingerprints and short summaries
- HUD itself is purely observational; install/uninstall links jump to existing Dashboard protected pages

## 📊 Data accounting

- **Three cost buckets**: `actual` (provider billing) / `estimated` (per-model price table) / `unbilled`. Without billing data everything is labeled "local estimate"
- **No double counting**: main sessions come from `sessions`; auxiliary calls only from `session_model_usage.task != ''` (`task=''` rows duplicate main-session billing and are excluded); API calls sum the database's `api_call_count`
- **Statistics timezone**: `HUD_TIMEZONE` (e.g. `Asia/Shanghai`) > system local timezone > UTC; UTC epochs are converted only at query time
- **state.db fully read-only**: `mode=ro` + short timeout + `query_only`, never blocks the Gateway
- **Incident counts**: `observations` = times observed, `state_changes` = substantive state changes; 2s-poll observations are not presented as "trigger counts"

## 🩺 Health rules (thresholds overridable via `HUD_*` env vars)

| Level | Rule |
|---|---|
| 🔴 critical | Gateway process not alive; state.db unreadable; disk < 5%; Cron consecutive failures ≥ 3 |
| 🟡 warning | Channel connected but heartbeat > 60s (jitter); > 20 errors in 30 min; disk < 15%; memory > 85%; launchd unmanaged; today's cost over 80% of daily budget |

> Field experience: `gateway_state.json` is written on state *changes*, not as a periodic heartbeat (it can be 60+ minutes stale while the process is healthy). Therefore **process liveness is the critical criterion**; a stale state file is only a warning.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Dashboard shows the desktop boot screen** ("Desktop boot failed"): when started from a Hermes desktop-app shell, `HERMES_DESKTOP=1` + `HERMES_WEB_DIST` are inherited; start with `env -u HERMES_WEB_DIST -u HERMES_DESKTOP -u HERMES_SERVE_HEADLESS hermes dashboard ...`
- **Menu language resets to English after restart**: menu language lives in browser localStorage (`hermes-locale`), unrelated to server restarts; the HUD Settings tab has a one-click "set Chinese menu"
- **Plugin not showing**: make sure `scripts/enable_dashboard_plugin.py enable` ran, then restart the dashboard
- **Backend 401**: in loopback mode the token is injected into the page HTML; the frontend carries it automatically. For curl, extract it first

## 🧩 Compatibility

- **Tested: macOS**; Linux expected to work (community testing welcome); Windows experimental
- Hermes Agent ≥ 0.19.0
  (Dashboard plugin SDK: manifest.json + plugin_api.py + IIFE bundle)
- The plugin itself survives Hermes upgrades; rebuild the web UI only if needed (`npm run build`)
- Full uninstall: `hermes plugins disable hermes-hud` + remove the plugin directory
